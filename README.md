## ðŸ‘‹ Hiya, I'm Sora!

### Also known as Sxnic by some people.

I'm a 23 year old developer from the Netherlands with a passion for almost anything in tech. Well, maybe except for CSS, but that's why I use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to make things easier for me.

Besides programming I also have a lot of experience in tech-related topics like Linux, server management and infrastructure, Docker and other tools, etc.

Like many other developers, I like to keep myself busy and develop my skills. And I even enjoy coding ouside of work. I am _almost_ always interested in new technologies, so when something new comes out, I am eager to check it out!

Aside from my technical hobbies, I also have a lot of other things that I enjoy doing, such as cooking, playing games, making pixel art, railfanning and learning foreign languages such as German and Japanese. **_Although I am neither fluent nor proficient in either of these languages, I really want to improve my skills at some point._**

### **Note**

My projects are spread across sveral platforms, such as GitLab and GitHub, but I will also be experimenting with my own self-hosted services in the future. You can find _almost_ all of my social stuff through my personal website.
